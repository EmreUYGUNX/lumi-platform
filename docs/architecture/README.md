# Architecture Documentation

Use this folder to capture system design artefacts as Lumi evolves across phases.

## Contents

- [`overview.md`](overview.md) – High-level system context and runtime interactions.
- [`tech-stack.md`](tech-stack.md) – Approved technologies and rationale.
- Future ADRs (`adr/`), C4 diagrams, and deployment topologies will live here as the platform matures.

Keep this folder synchronized with the architecture decision process and update references in `docs/README.md` after adding new artefacts.
